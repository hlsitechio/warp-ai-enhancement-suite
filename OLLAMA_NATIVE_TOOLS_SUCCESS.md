## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Script Created**: `OllamaToolsIntegration.ps1`

```powershell
# Web search example
.\OllamaToolsIntegration.ps1 -Query "What are the latest AI developments?"

# Calculator example  
.\OllamaToolsIntegration.ps1 -Query "Calculate the square root of 144"

# File operations example
.\OllamaToolsIntegration.ps1 -Query "List the contents of my current directory"
```

### **Core Features**
